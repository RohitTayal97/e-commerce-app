        Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California
        in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong and bassist
        and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For much of the band's career, they
        have been a trio with a drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in
        1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk
        (1991). Touring guitarist Jason White became a full-time member in 2012,
        but returned to his role as a touring member in 2016.

        Green Day was originally part of the late-'80s/early-'90s punk scene at
        the DIY 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early
        releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In
        1994, their major-label debut Dookie, released through Reprise Records,
        became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies
        in the U.S. Green Day is credited alongside fellow California punk bands
        NOFX, Sublime, Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, and Jawbreaker with
        popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.

        Though the albums Insomniac (1995), Nimrod (1997), and Warning (2000)
        did not match the success of Dookie, they were still successful with the
        former two reaching double platinum status while the latter achieved
        gold. Green Day's seventh album, a rock opera called American Idiot
        (2004), found popularity with a younger generation, selling six million
        copies in the U.S. Their next album, 21st Century Breakdown, was
        released in 2009 and achieved the band's best chart performance. It was
        followed by a trilogy of albums, ¡Uno!, ¡Dos!, and ¡Tré!, released in
        September, November, and December 2012, respectively. The trilogy did
        not perform as well as expected commercially in comparison to their
        previous albums largely due to lack of promotion and Armstrong entering
        rehab. Their twelfth studio album, Revolution Radio, was released in
        October 2016 and became their third to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard
        200. The band's thirteenth studio album, Father of All Motherfuckers,
        was released on February 7, 2020.

        Green Day has sold more than 75 million records worldwide, making them
        one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[1] The group has been
        nominated for 20 Grammy awards and has won five of them with Best
        Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot and
        21st Century Breakdown, Record of the Year for "Boulevard of Broken
        Dreams", and Best Musical Show Album for American Idiot: The Original
        Broadway Cast Recording.

        In 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway. The
        musical was nominated for three Tony Awards: Best Musical, Best Scenic
        Design, and Best Lighting Design, winning the latter two. The band was
        inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015, their first year
        of eligibility. In 2018, members of Green Day, along with several
        friends, formed the side project The Coverups to perform cover songs.
